                <h1>PART 1; Making a new account</h1>
                <p>So this is where you start off, new account to make. But how? You need to make a new name, and also an email. Email is pretty important for this step.</p>
                <p>If you don't want to use your personal email, you have to use a temporary mail. There's often chances that it won't work and spit out this error:</p>
                <ol id="ErrorBox" class="alignlefterror">
                    <li>The use of disposable e-mail addresses or e-mail forwarders has been disabled. Please use a real e-mail address. The e-mail provider in question is <i>[Provider Name]</i></li>
                </ol>
                <p>But if you manage to get the email disposed to you and create the account.. You're good!</p>
